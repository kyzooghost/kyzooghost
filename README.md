# Hi there 🤗

Once upon a time, I was a doctor 👨‍⚕️.
Now I’m a dev who stitches code instead of people.  
Turns out, debugging is just as messy as surgery.

## 🛠 My Happy Place (Comfort Stack)

- **Blockchain sorcery** 🪄  
  Solidity · Foundry · Hardhat · EVM wizardry
  
- **Frontend mischief** 🎨  
  React/NextJS & Angular — because why pick just one flavour of JavaScript pain?
  
- **Backend muscle** 🏋️  
  Node.js · C#/.NET · Java - APIs that actually work
  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure adventures** ☁️⚙️  
  Kubernetes · AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate) · Docker · Terraform - containerising, orchestrating, and deploying stuff that *hopefully* works on the first try
  
- **Scripts & automation** 🤖  
  Python · Bash — perfect for that “one quick script” that grows into a monster

## 🌱 Currently Poking At

- Golang (the gopher is cute, okay?)  
- Rust (safety *and* speed — my inner doctor approves)  
- Solana (faster than my coffee kicks in)  
- Big-picture system architecture
