# Hi there 🤗

Once upon a time, I was a doctor 👨‍⚕️  
Now I’m a dev who stitches code instead of people.  
Turns out, debugging is just as messy as surgery.

## 🛠 My Happy Place (Comfort Stack)

- **Blockchain Sorcery** 🪄  
  Solidity · Foundry · Hardhat · EVM - conjuring contracts that survive mainnet

- **Cloud & DevOps** ☁️  
  AWS · Kubernetes · Terraform · GitHub Actions · Prometheus · Grafana - infrastructure as code, observability as a hobby, prod deploys on a Friday

- **Backend Muscle** 🏋️  
  Node.js · C#/.NET · Java - APIs that actually work

- **Frontend Mischief** 🎨  
  React/NextJS & Angular - because why pick just one flavour of JavaScript pain?
  
## 🌱 Currently Poking At

- AI agents (everyone is, let’s be honest)
- Golang (the gopher is cute, okay?)  
- Solana (faster than my coffee kicks in)  
- Big-picture system architecture
