# Hi there 🤗

Once upon a time, I was a doctor 👨‍⚕️,  
now I’m a dev who stitches code instead of people.  
Turns out, debugging is way less messy than surgery (usually).

## 🛠 My Happy Place (Comfort Stack)

- **Blockchain sorcery** 🪄  
  Solidity · Foundry · Hardhat · Ethers.js · EVM wizardry
  
- **Frontend mischief** 🎨
  Angular & React — because why pick just one flavour of JavaScript pain?
  
- **Backend muscle** 🏋️  
  Node.js · C#/.NET · APIs that actually work
  
- **Cloud adventures** ☁️  
  AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate) · Docker · Terraform · AWS CDK
  
- **Scripts & automation** 🤖  
  Python · Bash — perfect for that “just one quick script” that grows into a monster

## 🌱 Currently Poking At

- Golang (the gopher is cute, okay?)  
- Rust (safety *and* speed — my inner doctor approves)  
- Solana (faster than my coffee kicks in)  
- Kubernetes (because I clearly like overcomplicating my dev environment)  
- Big-picture system architecture
